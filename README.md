# Starter Seed

A starter project for the Ultimate AngularJS [Starter course](https://courses.toddmotto.com).

### Course members

I'd love to see what you've built after mastering the core of AngularJS, consider submitting a PR to this repo to a new branch name (under your chosing). That way, solutions or things you've built after this course would be amazing to see! I wish you luck in your endeavours.

> Non-course members (this project is open source on GitHub)

Checkout the `solution` directory for an awesome Todo App. If you want to build exactly that and learn the mechanics behind it (and much more) then dive into [Ultimate AngularJS: Starter Course](https://courses.toddmotto.com/products/ultimate-angularjs-starter).
